<p>getting it setup on the desk before it goes in a rack, dahm these are loud, extra points for RGB. OS of choice for servers is Ubuntu server edition as its install is painless and has all the drivers for raid controllers and is possible to add open SHH from the install and no need to do it later.</p>

<h4>Hardware needed </h4>
<ol>
<li>a geared extruder </li>
<li>bi metal hotend</li>
</ol>
<p>the cheap all metal geared extruders for the ender 3 are cheap and allow for the filament to be pushed harder and retreated faster, price £8 free shipping, the Bi metal hotend is magic the bottom made of titanium of the hotend remains hot allowing for high flow rates but the top made of copper tranmits the heat away from the filament preventing heat creep. </p>
<h4>software </h4>
<p>the ender 3 bowden tube is known for causing issues with clogging and resistant too pressure change that retraction and changes in speed of extruding cause. so we want to keep the pressure in the tube as constant as possible. we do this with automatic speed on prusia slicer you have measure the max flow rate of the hotend mine maxed out at 8mm^2/s with PLA, then slicer takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>the steppers on the ender 3v2 have a lot more torque than you'll expect so its simple to go into the firmware and up the acceleration until it didn't skip.</p>

                <p>For AutoCrat to put ink to paper it needs a way of automatic writng and for this we use the humble pen plotter. while at first glance is a complex machine with all the belts and pulleys's</p>
<h2>how a pen plotter works</h2>
<p>A pen plotter moves its x-y platform by using a combination of stepper motors and belts, just like a 3D printer. However, instead of extruding plastic, a pen plotter holds a pen or other writing instrument that is moved across the surface of a piece of paper or other material. The platform is typically mounted on a set of linear bearings, which allow it to move smoothly and accurately in the x-y plane. As the motors turn, the belts pull the platform in the desired direction, allowing the plotter to create precise drawings and designs. By carefully controlling the motion of the platform and the pen, pen plotters can produce highly detailed and accurate artwork.<img loading="lazy" src="https://3dwithus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Plotter-Toolhead-pltr-v1-Mounted-on-the-Anet-ET4X.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h2>How to talk pen plotter</h2>
<p>G-code is a programming language used to control the movements of pen plotters and other CNC machines. It consists of a series of commands that tell the plotter how to move the x-y platform and pen, when to turn the pen on and off, and at what speed to move.</p>
<p>In a pen plotter context, G-code is generated by a drawing program that creates a design or image, which is then converted into a series of G-code commands. These commands tell the plotter how to move the x-y platform and pen to recreate the design on a piece of paper or other material.</p>
<p>For example, a G-code command might look something like this: G1 X10 Y20 E0.3 F300. This command would tell the plotter to move the x-y platform to position X=10, Y=20 (measured in millimeters), while simultaneously lowering the pen to the paper and drawing a line with a thickness of 0.3mm at a speed of 300mm/min.</p>
<h2>Build time<br><br></h2>
<p>while borrowing a pen plotter that runs on the opensource GURBL firmware and using the gcode generator in Inkscape i did a couple test letters by using the hershies text function thats after a lot of messing around writing rude words and lines. </p>

<p>the toolchain for inkscape can not be automated but as a proff of concept it did produce nice results after much screaming at the sky i made one last item a map that now sits nicely one our wall</p>

                <p><br>AutoCrat is a project that aims to create a robot capable of reading, writing, and folding hand-written letters, as well as performing other "paperwork" tasks. The project is intended to be a cutting-edge robot that can revolutionize the way we handle our paperwork.<br><br>Before we dive into the nitty-gritty details of building AutoCrat, let's take a moment to understand what this project is all about. AutoCrat is essentially a robot that can perform tasks that are typically done by humans, such as reading and writing letters, filling out forms, and processing data. The idea behind AutoCrat is to automate mundane tasks so that humans can focus on more important things, like creativity and problem-solving.</p>
<h2>Step 1: where do we start</h2>
<p>oh boi this is going to be big so lets split this up into its individual parts these will change as /cross fingers</p>
<ol>
<li>something to write with eg. pen plotter</li>
<li>tool chain too convert text -&gt; SVG -&gt; Gcode</li>
<li>Ai too generate the text using an LLM </li>
<li>A way to generate believable handwriting </li>
<li>Folding paper</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 2: why</h2>
<p>no one likes paperwork and the people that do i dont understand so why not have a robot do it for you, what could go wrong.</p>
<h2>Step 3: where</h2>
<p>first copy of the AutoCrat will be unveiled at the <a href="https://www.emfcamp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EMF Camp</a> in 2024 </p>
