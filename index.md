### Personal Projects

#### Open source IoT Smart home Jan 2020

I built a raspberry system that linked into the offline functionality of the Amazon Alexa’s to control equipment that wasn't officially supported

- built using JavaScript in Node.red to translate the Alexa API to the Roku media control API
- A web interface hosted on the Pi allowed for manual operation 
- This required the reverse engineering of the undocumented offline Alexa code and media controls of the Roku. 

see it working below.

#### Home built Voice Assistant 2020 - present 

OpenHAB + **[Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**

building from the  Smart home build from earlier in the year i managed to install a local voice assistant program called rhasspy and have manged to train it to my voice for the purpose of controlling the HiFi and Roku, the technology is lot of more complex than amazon’s Alexa api and will have to work on build more scripts to interface more devices
